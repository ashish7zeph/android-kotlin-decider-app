Build a dinner decider android app with kotlin support


# what is it?

Here, I have made a Dinner Decider app in Android Studio using Kotlin support.

    This project contain two activities:
        * The first activity is a splash screen that appears for 4000 milliseconds
        * The second activity is the main activity and thats the main decider part

    CLICK on Decide Button -> a randomly decided food stuff will appear on the TextView from a predefined list
    CLICK on add a food EditText -> write any food stuff to be added
    CLICK on Add Food Button -> the food stuff written on above EditText will be add to the list
    CLICK on the TextView - > the list inside will be cleared

In this way if you have a confusion to select any food stuff for your dinner or any food restaurant for dinner,
you can put a list on this app and ask it to select anything randomly, for your ease!!
